## Introduction
The mini refrigerator leverages thermoelectric cooling via the Peltier module, which enables heat transfer across two junctions, achieving cooling without moving parts. This solid-state cooling approach is quieter, more compact, and ideal for personal or portable use.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a small-scale, portable refrigerator that:
- Provides cooling through the Peltier effect rather than conventional methods.
- Reduces complexity, weight, and environmental impact by eliminating compressors and refrigerants.

## Materials
- **Peltier Module**: Provides thermoelectric cooling based on the Peltier effect.
- **Heat Sink & Heat Sink Fan**: Ensures effective heat dissipation.
- **Thermocol**: Acts as an insulator to maintain cool temperatures inside the unit.
- **Thermal Paste**: Improves thermal transfer between surfaces.
- **PVC Sheets**: Durable outer casing for the unit.
- **12V Power Supply & DC Jack**: Provides required power to the Peltier module and fans.

## Construction and Working
1. **Box Setup**: Thermocol is used to construct the main cooling chamber due to its insulating properties.
2. **Peltier Module Placement**: The Peltier module is mounted with the cold side facing the cooling chamber and the hot side connected to a heat sink.
3. **Heat Dissipation**: A fan attached to the heat sink assists in dissipating excess heat generated on the hot side.
4. **Power Connection**: A 12V DC supply powers the Peltier module and the fan, achieving rapid cooling in the chamber.

## Benefits & Limitations
**Benefits**:
- Eco-friendly (no refrigerants).
- Lightweight and portable.
- Quiet operation with no vibrations.

**Limitations**:
- Suitable for small items only.
- Limited cooling capacity compared to traditional refrigerators.

## Power Consumption
The mini fridge consumes approximately 47.5W, with the Peltier module being the primary power-consuming component. Additional small fans aid in heat dissipation with minimal added power.

## Cost Estimation
| Component          | Price (BDT) |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Peltier Module     | 300         |
| Heat Sink (3)      | 180         |
| Heat Sink Fan (2)  | 140         |
| Thermocol          | 20          |
| 12V Power Supply   | 600         |
| PVC Sheets         | 100         |
| Female DC Jack     | 10          |
| Thermal Paste      | 100         |
| **Total**          | **1450**    |

## Applications
- **Portable Cooling**: Ideal for small items such as cans, snacks, and medications.
- **Personal Refrigerator**: Compact and low-maintenance, suitable for personal use.
- **Eco-Friendly Solutions**: Eliminates the need for refrigerants, aligning with sustainability goals.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates a low-power, portable refrigerator using the Peltier effect. The unit is compact, lightweight, and eco-friendly, offering a viable cooling solution for small-scale applications.
